* require_once() of core files.
With the namespace change all class files were moved to a
location where they can be found from the autoloader. While
old class names still work through an alias system, the
old class files were kept only for backwards compatibility to
not trigger a fatal in case someone calls require() or
require_once() on them. Those compat files are removed. This
is an issue if old extensions still use those calls. Usually
the calls can be just removed from the extension.
