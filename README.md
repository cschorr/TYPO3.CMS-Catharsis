TYPO3-CMS-Catharsis
===================

Vision / Catharsis fork of TYPO3 CMS

This is an integration, sandbox, vision and incubator fork of TYPO3 CMS aiming to get bigger things done more quickly.

It is currently unclear if and when the development done here will be merged to mainline.

Development rules from mainline still apply to this project: Coding standards must be followed and broken code is not accepted. Still, some rules are loosened a bit, it is for example possible to break certain things regarding backwards compatibily if there are good reasons for it and if the overall project is not harmed. It is also ok to drop some things that are hard to fight through in mainline, an example is the newline at end of php file and the closing php operator rule.

Feel free to contact us if you want to do bigger things here, send pull requests and fork the project.

Based on TYPO3 CMS master "6.1" branch from 13.02.2013 with its latest commit 2903d2cd712e53702bf6477029b18bd09a057099
